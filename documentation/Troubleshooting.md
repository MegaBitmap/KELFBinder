# Troubleshooting
To discover why the program is not functioning properly


## debug colors
under certain scenarios, the program will change the screen color and freeze.

here is the list of those colors and their meaning:

### Purple
The exact color is: ![purple](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20-%20-800080)

meaning: KELFBinder could not find the installation table manifest.

The expected location of this script is `INSTALL/EXTINST.lua`

### White
The exact color is: ![white](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%20%20%20%20-%20%20%20%20%20-ffffff)

meaning: KELFBinder could not find the main script file

The expected location of this script is `INSTALL/KELFBinder.lua`

### Black (with small white dot on screen center)
meaning: the program somehow crashed on a certain point between loading standard language strings and loading the main script
